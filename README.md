# 🐍 30 Days of Python

Welcome to my **30 Days of Python** journey! 🎯

This repository contains my daily Python practice as I work through foundational concepts in Python over the course of 30 days. Each day focuses on a specific topic, with hands-on exercises and mini projects to reinforce my learning.
