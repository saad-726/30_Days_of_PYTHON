# 🐍 30 Days of Python

Welcome to my **30 Days of Python** journey! 🎯

This repository contains my daily Python practice as I work through foundational concepts in Python over the course of 30 days. Each day focuses on a specific topic, with hands-on exercises and mini projects to reinforce my learning.

---


## ✅ Progress Tracking

I have completed:

- [x] Day 1 to Day 14  
- [ ] Day 15 and beyond (in progress)  
✔️ Each day's progress is committed with a separate file (e.g., `day_1.py`, `day_2.py`, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Final Goal

At the end of 30 days, I will build a mini Python project using all the concepts learned. The project idea will be decided during the last week and added to this repo.
